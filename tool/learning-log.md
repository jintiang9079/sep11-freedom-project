## Tool: **Kaboom**

## Project: **tbd**

---

### 9/29/25:
* Looked through [Kaboom's official website](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup) documentary
   * Learned that `kaboom()` starts the game
   * Learned how to add movements to kaboom games.
* Played around with the [Kaboom's playground examples](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=movement)
  * `onKeyDown` allows the website to detect what key you press.
* While playing around, how the keywords work with kaboom sometimes confuses me as it's sort of complicated.
* How do I create objectives for games?
  * Is the objective made by specific coding or is there templates?
* Next steps
  * Probably creating a mini-project game about movement and any side tasks.
  * Look through more specific tutorials for my future main project.
