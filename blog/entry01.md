## Content
For my freedom project, I've decided on Kaboom as my main tool for creating my game because it's beginner-friendly and offers simple game-making code. I have tinkered with kaboom by:
* Looking through their documentary
* Playing around with their template beginner project
* Adding new features on my own  
More of the tinkering details could be found in my [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md).
  
I am basically going to make a game where you are trying to play a game but you get loaded into the tutorial level, and the whole game would be about the tutorial level, the tutorial would troll you, and make you have to restart every time you fail.
## Sources
Besides Kaboom, I've also have considered another tool:
* Phaser | [Phaser's documentation](https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser) | This is also just another game-making tool that's similar to Kaboom.
  
Other than that, it's only Kaboom, here's [Kaboom's documentation](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup).
## EDP
The current stage of my engineering design process is still researching and tinkering around with my tool, I plan to start making my tool after I feel comfortable with how everything worked better.  
  
<h3>Next plans</h3>
My plans for the next stage is to begin the basic set ups of my game after I'm done researching about my tool.  

## Skills
In conclusion, some skills that I've developed during this blog would be:
* Tinkering, I've learned how to tinker properly with my tool by using IDE and changing, also implementing features with my tool.
* Researching, I've learned how to research about my tool's information.
