## Content
So I continued with my tool Kaboom, and I also got a partner for this project. We've deicded on a theme of dinosaur tutorial game, it's like "T-rex Game" but with a tutorial that trolls you. I've been learning my tool and recording what I learnt in my [Learning Log](https://github.com/jintiang9079/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/learning-log.md), I plan to code while reading what I wrote down in my Learning Log, as they contain the necessary information for me to fully understand my codes. For example, I learnt how to add movement to my game sprite:  
(The comments will explain each line of code)
```js
const speed = 200; // Walk Speed
onKeyDown("d", () => { // When user hold down or press the d key
  bean.move(speed, 0) // The sprite "bean" will move to the right
})
```  
  
My goal during the winter break for my Freedom Project is to at least code some mini projects that relate to our main project goal, such as creating mini tutorial games, end screen, and more.
## Sources
I've been learning about Kaboom using their [official documentation website](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup) and also sometimes looking at this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM1iSvloMlo) to learn advanced code. I plan on combining my codes with other type of game coding documentations if possible, such as Phaser.
## EDP
My current EDP stage is making mini projects and doing basic setup of my game. I plan to work with my partner soon to actually start working on our game, as it is fairly simple to create our project.
  
<h3>Next plans</h3>  
For the next step, I plan to finally work on my game and also learn some advanced kaboom code that could help my project.
## Skills
In conclusion, some skills that I've developed during this blog would be:
* Teamwork, I've learned how to properly work with others during my time learning Kaboom's code, we helped each other out and eventually learnt more and easier.
* Time Management, I've learned how to manage my time in learning and when to play in my free time, such as 4-5 pm learning, and 6-7 pm playing.
